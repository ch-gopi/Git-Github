# Git-Github
Initializing Git For Version Control

Setting up Git for the first time on a new project is fairly simple, you just need to enter these five commands into your terminal. Be sure to be sitting in the directory where your project is located!

You only need to do this once, right when you start your new project. If you create a completely new project, youâ€™ll have to go through these commands again. But only once per projectâ€¦



$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

$ git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"

$ git config --global push.default matching

$ git config --global alias.co checkout

$ git init

## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ossamamehmood/Hacktoberfest2023
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing
```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run
```terminal
git merge upstream/main
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
